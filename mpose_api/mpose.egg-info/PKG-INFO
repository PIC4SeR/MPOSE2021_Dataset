Description: # MPOSE2021
        #### A Dataset for Short-time Pose-based Human Action Recognition
        
        This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time pose-based Human Action Recognition (HAR). 
        
        MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by 
        [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) [4], [Posenet](https://github.com/google-coral/project-posenet) [11], and [Movenet](https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral/blob/master/examples/movenet_pose_estimation.py) on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], KTH [8], UTKinetic-Action3D (RGB only) [9] and UTD-MHAD (RGB only) [10], alongside original video datasets, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1].
        Since these datasets have heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels are remapped to a common and homogeneous list of 20 actions.
        
        This repository allows users to generate pose data for MPOSE2021 in a python-friendly format. 
        Generated sequences have a number of frames between 20 and 30. 
        Sequences are obtained by cutting the so-called Precursor videos (from the above-mentioned datasets), with non-overlapping sliding windows.
        Frames where OpenPose/PoseNet/MoveNet cannot detect any subject are automatically discarded. Resulting samples contain one subject at a time, performing a fraction of a single action. Overall, MPOSE2021 contains 15429 samples, divided into 20 actions, performed by 100 subjects. 
        
        Below, the steps to install the ```mpose``` library and obtain sequences are explained. Source code can be found in the [MPOSE2021 repository](https://github.com/PIC4SeRCentre/MPOSE2021_Dataset).
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install MPOSE2021 as python package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mpose)
        ```
        pip install mpose
        ```
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        ```python
        # import package
        import mpose
        
        # initialize and download data
        dataset = mpose.MPOSE(pose_extractor='openpose', 
                              split=1, # 1, 2, 3
                              preprocess=None, # scale_and_center, scale_to_unit
                              config_file=None, # specify custom configuration (debug)
                              velocities=False, # if True, computes additional veocity channels
                              remove_zip=False, # if True, removes zip files after extraction
                              overwrite=False, # if True, overwrites old zip files
                              verbose=True)
        
        # print data info 
        dataset.get_info()
        
        # get data samples (as numpy arrays)
        X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = dataset.get_dataset()
        ```

        ### Class methods
        
        * `transform(fn=None, target='X')`: apply custom transformation function to the data.
          * `fn`: the function (fn(X) or fn(y))
          * `target`: the data target (X or y)
            
        * `reduce_keypoints()`: reduce the number of keypoints grouping head and feet landmarks [1]
            
        * `scale_and_center()`: center poses and resize to a common scale [1]
        
        * `scale_to_unit()`: rescale all pose data between 0 and 1
        
        * `add_velocities(overwrite=False)`: compute keypoint velocities and add them as new channels
          * `overwrite`: if True, recomputes velocities even if already present
        
        * `remove_velocities()`: remove velocity channels (if present)
        
        * `remove_confidence()`: remove confidence channel (if present)
        
        * `flatten_features()`: flatten (keypoints,channels) dimensions
        
        * `reduce_labels()`: map labels to a smaller set of actions (e.g. to realize small demos)
        
        * `reset_data()`: restore original data
        
        * `get_data(seq_id=False)`: get data samples (as numpy arrays)
          * `seq_id`: if True, returns also the lists of sample IDs correspondent to X_train and X_test
            
        * `get_info()`: print a summary of dataset statistics
                
        * `get_labels()`: get the list of action labels
